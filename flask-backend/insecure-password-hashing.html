  <h1>Insecure Password Hashing</h1>
  <p>
    Passwords should never be stored in plaintext. They should be hashed with a strong algo and salted. If they aren't, the <br />
    adversary can use rainbow tables and other cracking mechanisms to easily get the initial password.
  </p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Navigate to the flask-backend directory and inspect the init_db.py file. You will notice that the password is hashed using MD5. <br />
    This is a huge issue as MD5 is deprecated and trivial to crack. In VSCode, install the 
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer">SQLite Viewer extension</a> and inspect the <br />
    database.sqlite file. Copy the 32 bytes under the password column and plug it into <a href="https://crackstation.net/">CrackStation</a>. What is the initial password?
  </p>

  <h3>Remediation</h3>
  <p>
    Replace the MD5 hashing with a strong and secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or argon. Once working, plug the hash into<br />
    CrackStation again and see what happens.
